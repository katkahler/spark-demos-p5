# Summer Spark p5js and Processing Demos
### A collection of demos and projects that I wrote and taught for lessons during Summer Spark. Languages: JavaScript, Java Processing, Snap (UC Berkeley) (visual coding with blocks) 

I designed 10+ lessons for Summer Spark, including the entirety of our week dedicated to creative coding. Here I have examples of demos done in p5 and a few of the lesson plans as well! 

## **Week 1: Web & App Development**

For this week I taught four lessons: intro to buttons in p5js, intro to script.js using Glitch, pointillism in p5js, and intro to images. 
The sepia filter project was an extra challenge to image filtering to learn about accessing pixels in p5.

## **Week 2: Creative Coding**

All lessons for this week were designed for UC Berkeley's Snap and p5js.

This was the first lesson campers got on day one, working with drawing shapes on the canvas, and prioritizing order of lines of code. king-turtle is the demo.
[H - Getting and Setting.pdf](https://github.com/katkahler/spark-demos-p5/files/6851471/H.-.Getting.and.Setting.pdf) and  [E - Build a Brush.pdf](https://github.com/katkahler/spark-demos-p5/files/6851478/E.-.Build.a.Brush.pdf)
In this lesson, campers learned about finding color based on position in an image using the get() function in p5.Image. They then recreated the image in some way using the tools they already knew how to use. This crossed over with the previous lesson where campers learned how to use functions and variables related to the mouse. Pointillism, rainbow brush, and animatedDots were all demos and challenges for this lesson.

## **Week 3: Art of Games**

I taught throughout this week as well using Java Processing and other game-making websites such as Stencyl.
The 3D bouncing ball demo was an extra challenge added to the 2D bouncing ball lesson, used to teach if statements and animation.
