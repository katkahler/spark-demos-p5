# Summer Spark p5js and Processing Demos
A collection of demos and projects that I wrote and taught for lessons during Summer Spark

I designed 10+ lessons for Summer Spark, including the entirety of our week dedicated to creative coding. Here I have examples of demos done in p5 and a few of the lesson plans as well! Some of these projects were done in JavaScript using p5js and UC Berkeley's Snap software. A few other challenges were written in Java Processing.

This was the first lesson campers got on day one, working with drawing shapes on the canvas, and prioritizing order of lines of code. king-turtle is the demo.

In this lesson, campers learned about finding color based on position in an image using the get() function in p5.Image. They then recreated the image in some way using the tools they already knew how to use. This crossed over with the previous lesson where campers learned how to use functions and variables related to the mouse.
